# Banana bread baker

Banana bread baker uses Alexa Skills Kit Command Line Interface so that you can easily get the skill running in your own developer console.
This is a prototype for my Cros Cooking Skill I plan on finishing later, so I am not offering a license.
This skill uses quiet looping video for steps and process and normal video with audio for lessons in between those steps.
Voice control is key to this experience because users will have their hands busy (and probably a little dirty) while cooking and this frees them up to cook.

This is a live skill, the live code is not uploaded here.
